					<li>What are the advantages of Bootstrap? </li>
				</h2>
				<strong>Answere:</strong>
				<ul>
					<p>The bootstrap is an Open Source Front-End framework, used for Web Application development, made
						up of HTML, CSS and Java Scrip, which twitter has developed. This is a free program that anyone
						can download and use. And you can run it on any platform (Windows, Linux, Mac). Bootstrap gives
						you the option of using the Grid System which is known as one of the fastest and simplest ways
						to create a layout that saves you time.</p>
					<p>Bootstrap is used to make the website responsive, Responsive means that if you open a website in
						PC, open it in laptop or open in tablet or open in any small mobile, the screen size of
						bootstrap website will automatically adjusts, and the website content shows well. </p>
					<li><b>Bootstrap is Easy to Use:</b> Bootstrap is very easy and quite simple to use for designing
						and development. Being a new framework there is a lot to learn from it. It can be used with CSS,
						LESS or SaaS etc.</li>
					<li> <b>Fast and Time-Saving Framework:</b> Bootstrap is an agile framework which is quite faster
						than other frameworks. It saves time due to its standard ready-made coding blocks,
						responsiveness, and cross-browser capabilities.</li>
					<li> <b>Reinforcement of Grids:</b> One more recommendable feature is that bootstrap holds 12 column
						grid styles and supports responsiveness, counterbalance, and embedded elements.</li>
					<li><b>Bootstrap is totally Customizable:</b> It is developer friendly and can be customized as per
						the project requirements. Common CSS, utilities, Javascript Components, and components can
						compose the appearance to create ease for developers.</li>

				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>
					<li>What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work? </li>
				</h2>
				<strong>Answere:</strong>
				<ul>
					<p> Bootstrap, container is used to set the content's margins dealing with the responsive behaviors
						of your layout. It contains the row elements and the row elements are the container of columns
						(known as grid system).</p>
					<p>Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using default
						grid system. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within
						them. Although containers can be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.</p>
					<p><b>Bootstrap comes with three different containers:</b></p>
					<li>
						<p>.container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>.container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>.container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint</p>
					</li>
					<p>&raquo; It requires use with the default grid system.</p>
					<p>&raquo; To establish width for the layout to give web content.</p>
					<p>&raquo; To provide responsive fixed behavior of any web project.</p>
					<p>&raquo; To sets the content margin dealing with the responsive behavior of your layout.</p>

				<h2>
					<li>What are the default Bootstrap text settings? </li>
				</h2>
				<strong>Answere:</strong>
				<p>Bootstrap 4 uses a default font-size of 16px, and its line-height is 1.5. The default font-family is
					"Helvetica Neue", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif. In addition, all
				<p> elements have margin-top: 0 and margin-bottom: 1rem (16px by default).</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Bootstrap 4 styles HTML headings (&lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt;) with a bolder font-weight and an
						increased font-size:</li>
					<li> <b>Display Headings:</b> &nbsp; Display headings are used to stand out more than normal
						headings (larger font-size and lighter font-weight), and there are four classes to choose from:
						.display-1, .display-2, .display-3, .display-4
					</li>
					<li><b> &lt;small&gt;</b> &nbsp;In Bootstrap 4 the HTML &lt;small&gt; element is used to create a
						lighter, secondary text in any heading:
					</li>
					<li><b> &lt;mark&gt;</b>&nbsp; Bootstrap 4 will style the HTML &lt;small&gt; element with a yellow
						background color and some padding:
					</li>
					<li><b> &lt;abbr&gt;</b>&nbsp; Bootstrap 4 will style the HTML &lt;abbr&gt; element with a dotted
						border bottom:
					</li>
					<li><b> &lt;blockquote&gt;</b>&nbsp; Add the .blockquote class to a &lt;blockquote&gt; when quoting
						blocks of content from another source:
					</li>

				<h2>
					<li>What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System? </li>
				</h2>
				<strong>Answere:</strong>
				<ul>
					<h3>Grid system</h3>
					<p>Bootstrap grid is a powerful system for building mobile-first layouts. It's very extensive tool
						with a great number of options.</p>
					<p>Bootstrap’s grid system uses a series of containers, rows, and columns to arrange and align
						content. It’s built with flexbox and is fully responsive.</p>
					<li><b>Container</b> &nbsp;Bootstrap requires a containing element to wrap site contents and house
						our grid system. Without a container, the grid won't work properly.
					</li>
					<li><b>Row</b>&nbsp;Rows create horizontal groups of columns. Therefore, if you want to split your
						layout horizontally, use .row.
					</li>
					<li><b>Columns</b>&nbsp;Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.</li>

				<h2>
					<li>What is the difference between Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap 5 ?</li>
				</h2>
				<strong>Answere:</strong>
				<div>It is an open-source framework from late 2011 that is used for designing responsive websites with a
					mobile-first approach faster and easier. Bootstrap is available for HTML, CSS, and JS. According to
					server-side languages like PHP, Node, etc. bootstrap helps to design the frontend. Bootstrap has
					made the work for developers easier by making the templates ready which are basic part of every
					website. Thus people tend to develop further and don’t waste time on basic templates with beautiful
					designs along with responsiveness available. </div>
				<br>
				<div>Bootstrap 5 alpha launched in mid-June of 2020. As it is in the alpha-1 version, in the future some
					more features can be added to bootstrap 5</div>

				<h2>
					<li>What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group? </li>
				</h2>
				<strong>Answere:</strong>
				<div>
					“Button Groups” in Bootstrap is a class of name “btn-group” which is used to create series of
					buttons in groups (without spaces) vertically or horizontally. This is the basic syntax of the
					button group class where each button has its own class of “btn”
				</div>
				&lt;div class="btn-group"&gt;
				&lt;button type="button" class="btn">Click&gt;/button&gt;
				&lt;/div&gt;
				<p>Buttons have a default border-radius on the first and last buttons of the group.</p>
				<p><b>Adding Styles on Buttons:</b> Bootstrap allows you to add styles to your buttons using the
					following classes:
				<ul>
					<li>.btn-default</li>
					<li>.btn-primary</li>
					<li>.btn-success</li>
					<li>.btn-info</li>
					<li>.btn-warn</li>
					<li>.btn-dang</li>
					<li>.btn-link</li>

				<h2>
					<li>How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails? </li>
				</h2>
				<strong>Answere:</strong>
				<div><b>Bootstrap:</b> helps web developers to create thumbnails that are used to show linked images in
					grids with the pre-defined classes which help to reduce codes length. Thumbnails are created to
					provide a quick preview of images with small images.
				</div>
				<p><b>Thumbnail Image:</b> A thumbnail is a small image that represents a larger image. Bootstrap has an
					easy way to do this with thumbnails. Bootstrap’s .thumbnail class is used to show linked images in
					grids (grid system), a thumbnail is created using class .thumbnail within the element &lt;a&gt;. The
					class .col-sm-* and .col-md-* (where * represent number ), it is used to create grids of the images.
				</p>
				<ol>
					<h3>Step by step guide for the implementation:</h3>
					<li><b>Step 1:</b> Include Bootstrap and jQuery CDN into the

						<head> tag before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.
					</li>
					<li><b>Step 2:</b> Add &lt;div&gt; tag in the HTML body with class row. In that &lt;div&gt; create
						four div sections to create four images.</li>
					<li><b>Step 3:</b> Add “col-sm-6” and “col-md-3” to four div sections which creates webpage
						responsive.</li>
					<li><b>Step 4:</b> Add &lt;a&gt; tag with class value thumbnail to define the link of the image in
						the next line. </li>
				</ol>

				<h2>
					<li>In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?</li>
				</h2>
				<strong>Answere:</strong>
				<div><b>Bootstrap 4 Flex</b> The biggest difference between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is that
					Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox, instead of floats, to handle the layout.</div><br>
				<div>The Flexible Box Layout Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive layout structure
					without using float or positioning</div>
				<p>It’s important to understand that Bootstrap 4’s grid system is built with Flexbox. What sets
					Bootstrap apart from using Flexbox alone is the process of writing code. With Bootstrap, you can
					create a grid using only HTML. With Flexbox, you must use HTML and CSS. Let’s take a closer look at
					each process below.</p>
				<p>Bootstrap has a twelve-column system, which means there can be up to twelve grid columns on a single
					horizontal block. You can have more than twelve, they’ll just start to wrap rather than show up on a
					single axis, regardless of the viewport.</p>

				<h2>
					<li>How can one create an alert in Bootstrap? </li>
				</h2>
				<strong>Answere:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Step 1:</b> Include Bootstrap and jQuery CDN into the &lt;head&gt; tag before all other
						stylesheets to load our CSS.</li>
					<li><b>Step 2:</b> Add the .alert and the warning alert contextual classes (e.g., .alert-warning).
					</li>
					<li><strong>Sample Code:</strong></li>
					<i>&lt;div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert"&gt;
						A simple warning alert—check it out!
						&lt;/div&gt;</i>
					<li>
						<p>Bootstrap provides an easy way to create predefined alert messages:</p>
						<div class="alert alert-success">
							<strong>Success!</strong> Indicates a successful or positive action.
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-info">
							<strong>Info!</strong> Indicates a neutral informative change or action.
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-warning">
							<strong>Warning!</strong> Indicates a warning that might need attention.
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-danger">
							<strong>Danger!</strong> Indicates a dangerous or potentially negative action.
						</div>
						<div class="alert alert-danger alert-dismissible">
							<a href="#" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="close">&times;</a>
							<strong>Danger!</strong> This alert box could indicate a dangerous or potentially negative
							action.
