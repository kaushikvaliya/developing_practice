                    <h3>what is Javascript?</h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>
                    <p> JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features
                        on web
                        pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for
                        you to
                        look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
                        scrolling video
                        jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. </p>

                    <h3>what is the use of isnan function ?</h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>

                    <p>The isNaN() function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not. It
                        returns true
                        if value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the Number.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>what is negative infinity ?</h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>

                    <p>The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value which is used to represent a value which
                        is the
                        lowest available. This means that no other number is lesser than this value. It can be generated
                        using a
                        self-made function or by an arithmetic operation.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>which company developed javascript</h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>

                    <p>The first ever JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape, and has since been updated to
                        conform
                        to ECMA-262 Edition 5 and later versions. This engine, code named SpiderMonkey, is implemented
                        in C/C++
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>what are undeclared and undefined variables ? </h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>

                    <p>Undeclared − It occurs when a variable which hasn’t been declared using var, let or const is
                        being tried
                        to access. </p>

                    <p> Undefined − It occurs when a variable has been declared using var, let or const but isn’t given
                        a value.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>write the code for adding new elements dynamically ?</h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>

                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>what is the difference between viewstate and sessionstate ?</h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>

                    <p>The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage state at the client’s
                        end,
                        making state management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the server’s end,
                        making
                        it easy to manage content from this end too.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>what is == operator ?</h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>

                    <p>The equality operator ( == ) checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean
                        result.
                        Unlike the strict equality operator, it attempts to convert and compare operands that are of
                        different
                        types</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>how can the style/class of an element be changed ?</h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>

                    <p>The class name is used as a selector in HTML which helps to give some value to the element
                        attributes.
                        The document. getElementById() method is used to return the element in the document with the
                        “id”
                        attribute and the “className” attribute can be used to change/append the class of the element
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3> how to read and write a file using JavaScript ? </h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>

                    <p>ReadFile() and rs. writeFile() methods are used to read and write of a file using javascript. The
                        file is
                        read using the fs. readFile() function, which is an inbuilt method.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>
                    <ul class="u-list">
                        <li> for - loops through a block of code a number of times.</li>
                        <li> for/in - loops through the properties of an object.</li>
                        <li> for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object.</li>
                        <li> while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>
                    <p>In JavaScript parseInt() function (or a method) is used to convert the passed in string parameter
                        or value to an integer value itself. This function returns an integer of base which is specified
                        in second argument of parseInt() function. parseInt() function returns Nan( not a number) when
                        the string doesn’t contain number.</p>

                    <p> Syntax <span> parseInt(Value, radix) </span></p>
                    <p>

                        It accepts string as a value and converts it to specified radix system (any desired numerical
                        value passed by a user) and returns an integer (corresponding to the passed in numerical radix
                        value).
                    </p>


                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>What is the function of the delete operator?</h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>

                    <p>The delete operator removes a given property from an object. On successful deletion, it will
                        return true , else false will be returned.</p>
                </li>

                    <h3>What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?</h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>

                    <p> JavaScript has three kind of popup boxes:</p>
                    <ul class="u-list">

                        <li> Alert box</li>
                        <li> Confirm box</li>
                        <li> Prompt box</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h3>What is the use of Void (0)?</h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>

                    <p>JavaScript void 0 means returning undefined (void) as a primitive value. You might come across
                        the term “JavaScript:void(0)” while going through HTML documents. It is used to prevent any side
                        effects caused while inserting an expression in a web page. </p>

                    <p class="ans"> Example:</p>
                    <p>
                        &lt;a href=" " onclick=" alert ( ' You have clicked the button ' ) > Click here ! &lt;/a&gt;
                    </p>
                    <p>Click on the above link. Even though the code within it specifies to display a message in an
                        alert
                        box (and this action does take place), the page will reload automatically.</p>
                    <p>We can fix this with void(0): </p>
                    <p> &lt;a href = " javascript : void ( 0 ) ; " onclick = " alert ( ' You have clicked the button '
                        )&gt;
                        Click here ! &lt;/a&gt;
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</h3>
                    <p class="ans">answer:</p>
                    <p>In this article, we will see how can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <P><b>Approach:</b> We can use window.location property inside the script tag to forcefully load
                        another
                        page in
                        Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of
                        the
                        document.
                        We can change the URL of a window by accessing it.</P>
                    <p>Syntax:</p>
                    <p>
                        &lt;script> <br>
                        window .location = &lt;Path / URL> <br>
                        &lt;/script>
                    </p>
                    <p>Example:</p>
                    <p>
                        &lt;script> <br>
                        window .location = "https://www.google.com/" <br>
                        &lt;/script>
                    </p>
                    <p>So in the above example, we see that by changing the window.location Object inside Javascript we
                        can
                        change the
                        URL of our window and thus successfully load any page forcibly from our Javascript without any
                        href
                        tag. We will
                        build a small working sample to learn it practically.
